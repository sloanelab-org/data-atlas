## About the Data Atlas

The Data Atlas is a tabular visualisation mapping out the Sloane Collections across different information systems. Each information system is visualised as a 'continent' on the atlas. Major continents are the British Museum, the British Library and the Natural History Museum, whereas satellite continents including the Royal Society, Adam Mathhew Digital and the digitisation projects Enlightenment Architectures and the Sloane Letters. At the top of the atlas, a table titled "Sloane's Manuscript Catalogues Today" visualises the status, location and level of digitisation of Sloane's Manuscript catalogues.

## How to Read the Atlas

Every continent is comprised in sections, e.g. the sections of the Natural History Museum are "Sloane Manuscript Catalogues", "Collection Guides" and "Objects". Each section visualises in separate columns and with colour-coding the level of digitisation, ranging from offline resource "Tangible artefact", on the first, far-left column through to "Imaged  and Machine Readable" on the third, far-right column.
